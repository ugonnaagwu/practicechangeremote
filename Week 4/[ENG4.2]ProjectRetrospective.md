# Project Retrospective
## Week 4, Lesson 3

A project retrospective provides "an opportunity for your team to reflect on what has occurred and to construct ways to become better going forward. " [The Ultimate Guide to Agile Retrospectives](https://www.retrium.com/ultimate-guide-to-agile-retrospectives/retrospectives-101). 

The retrospective gives your team a chance to:

* Step back to reflect on your work as a team
* Appreciate what you’ve accomplished
* Propose improvements/share concerns
* Plan actions for the next project
* As a team, quickly brainstorm a list of things that went well during the project (+) and things you'd like to change (∆) for next time.

Prepare your retrospective by answering the following questions as a team:

* What worked well?
* What didn't go so well?
* What have you learned?
* What still puzzles you?
