# Welcome to Week 3

Last week you expanded on your solution ideas getting feedback in customer interviews and prototyping. This week as a team you'll narrow down your solution to what you're going to build.

By the end of the week:
* [PM3.0](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum-PreSummer/blob/a1ef2fa7d6958574910872a3f8bced298862a0ee/Week%203/%5BPM3.0%5DCompetitor%20audit.md) Complete a competitor audit to better differentiate your solution and refine your value prop and pitch.
* [PM3.1](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum-PreSummer/blob/a1ef2fa7d6958574910872a3f8bced298862a0ee/Week%203/%5BPM3.1%5DSpec.md) Complete a spec for your solution. You'll see how the deliverables you've worked on the past few weeks combine into the spec. The missing piece is the walkthrough and engineering breakdown.
* [PM3.2](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum-PreSummer/blob/a1ef2fa7d6958574910872a3f8bced298862a0ee/Week%203/%5BPM3.2%5DWalkthrough.md) Together as a team complete a final walkthrough of what you're going to build. Include the screen by screen breakdown in your spec to define what you're building and how.

Before you move on to building your solution, get spec sign-off from your coaches. To expedite the process, share along the way as you build your spec and final walkthrough. Get their feedback early and often. The target for spec sign-off is by end of day, next Tuesday 7/20.
