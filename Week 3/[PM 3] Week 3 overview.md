# PM Week 3 
Welcome to week 3. This week is focused on completing your spec and a high-fidelity walk through. After this week you’ll begin building your solution once coaches sign-off on the spec. 

## Recommended schedule 
It’s up to the team to work through the design phases together. The resources can be found in: [Week 3](/Week%203).  

Here’s a recommended schedule: 

*  Monday: Read [PM3.0 Competitor audit]([PM3.0]Competitor%20audit.md), [PM3.1 Spec]([PM3.1]Spec.md), and [PM3.2 Walkthrough]([PM3.2]Walkthrough.md) to understand the path for completing the spec. Break up work and start on competitor audit and walkthrough. 

* Tuesday-Friday: Work on walkthrough and spec. Divide and conquer. Share with coaches for feedback and input as you go. Share a final draft of the spec by the end of week. 

## Outcomes 
These are the deliverables you should end the week with. Your Teams folder is a good place to keep the files. 
* SWOT diagram 
* Walkthrough – apply what you learned in usability testing. Keep refining. Align in low fidelity before investing in higher fidelity mockups. 
* Spec – aim to sign-off with your coaches by 7/18. Ask for feedback early and during the week as you go.
