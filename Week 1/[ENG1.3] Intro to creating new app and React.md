# Intro to React and React Components

## Week 1, Lesson 4

This lesson covers React. It introduces how to create a new React App project. It describes generating the project with the React integrated tool chain, the pieces of the project, making changes, and running the project. It also goes through an example that permits to discover what React Components are.

## Learning objectives

- TNTs will be able to build a small React app.
- TNTs will be learn about components.

## Lesson details

### React (15 minutes)

- React as the component framework
  - [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) is an open source project from Facebook. It is used at Microsoft in web experiences across teams. IG, Netflix, New York Times, Khan Academy, WhatsApp, Dropbox... all use and contribute to React
  - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - UI is built in small, isolated pieces called components
  - Components tell React what to display on the screen
  - When the data changes, React _reacts_ and updates the screen
  - CSS is used to style React
  - React is the code behind rendering HTML in a webpage
- Look at some live examples on the [React homepage](https://reactjs.org).
  - Change some things in the live editor (e.g., change text, add HTML tags, change the value of the name attribute etc.) and observe the instantaneous results.
  - Check the box to use and not use JSX and observe.

### Created an app with create-react-app (20 minutes)

- `create-react-app` is a tool chain that permits to create a one-page React web app
- More info on [https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html](create-react-app)
- `create-react-app my-app` is the command to run in the terminal to create my-app
- Install `create-react-app` on the command line
  - create-react-app is a tool chain to generate a React app. It sets the environment and optimizes the app for production
  - Install create-react-app - `npm install -g create-react-app`
    - If this doesn't work then you might try putting the word 'sudo' before the rest of the command like so:
      `sudo npm install -g create-react-app`
    - sudo stands for 'super user do' - it'll ask you for your Mac password (NOT the v- Microsoft password) and then run the command as the administrator.
    - [![Funny Comic from XKCD about sudo.  No, really](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sandwich.png)](https://xkcd.com/149/)
- These GIFs may be helpful to get you started with `create-react-app`
  - [Install create-react-app](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/InstallCreateReactAppSmall.gif)
  - [Create an app](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/OpenCreateReactAppSmall.gif)
  - [Open the app](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/master/Reference/CreateReactAppTestSmall.gif)
- Demo of create-react-app
  - `create-react-app my-app` is the command to run in the terminal
  - Breaking down the command:
    - create-react-app - library for generating the environment
    - my-app - name of the app
    - Run the command
  - create-react-app ends with some helpful commands to run
    - cd - change directory to where the repo was created (here my-app)
    - Run `npm start` 
    - The browser opens. The app runs in the browser! The Node.js server is running locally.
- Folders/files of the project
  - Check the folder and the extensions of the files
  - Open the workspace folder in VS Code
    - Let us tour the content of what was generated
    - Some important folders/files
      - src folder - "source" working files to create the build
      - App.js - React module
      - App.css - top level style
      - index.js - React module
      - App.test.js - running test with Jest, more on this later
      - reportWebVitals.js - a performance relayer that allows you to measure and analyze the performance of your application using different metrics
      - public folder - can be opened from browser address bar
      - index.html - most common name for the default webpage of a website
      - .gitignore - tells Git which files or folder to ignore in a project such as editor backup and local configuration files
      - package.json - dependencies
      - README.md - scripts for project (start, build etc.) and links to learn more about create React app
    - Some other folders/files
      - node_modules folder - installed packages (will not be put in GitHub)
      - favicon.ico - the image that's displayed in a browser tab
      - logo.png - two sizes, displayed in the web page
      - logo.svg - scalable vector of logo
      - manifest.json - metadata for WebExtensions API, used for bookmarks and cross-browsers for compatibility
      - robots.txt - used by search engines for indexing
- Overview and discussion of the code
  - index.html - `root` is the id of the div element and is used in other files
  - App.js
    - Look at the imports
    - A function called `App` is created. App is a React component. It returns a JSX `<div>` element
    - JSX is JavaScript + XML
  - index.js
    - Notice the imports
    - The function `render` permits to render the App component into the root DOM
- Interacting with the app
  - Change something in one of the files (App.js, App.css) and save
    _ Observe the app re-render in the browser
    _ This is React in action!

### App architecture (15 minutes)

- TNTs draw what they have learned so far about app architecture
  - Display app architecture with labels, no descriptions
  - TNT groups talk through the functions of the different parts of a web app and how they connect
- Re-group and walk through architecture thus far together - HTML, CSS, React, Node...

### Going further: input-app-javascript (30 minutes)

- We will go together through th creation of a small app
- You can start with `my-app` or create a new React app
- The goal is create an app that updates a welcome string based on input text
- We will need to add a textbox for the user to enter text and listen on it. When it will change, the welcome text will be updated
- The finished code is available [here](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Samples/tree/main/Week_1/input-app-javascript) (input-app-javascript)
- (You can clone or download Samples to get the code)
- Be sure to run `npm install`
- We are going over the App.js code step by step
  - This app uses a class component (not a function). We use classes for components that have changing states
  - App extends `React.Component`
  - The state of the app is represented by a string called `name`
  - `name` is initialized to the empty string
  - We are adding the `<input>` tag with attribute `onChange` that will call `this.onChange`. input will create a textbox where the user will input text.
  - `this` refers to the current component
  - Notice the camel case notation for the `onChange` attribute due to the use of JSX
  - Define `onChange` as an anonymous function with fat arrow. It changes the state of the component using the `setState` function. It returns void.
  - `<input>` has an attribute `value` that contains `name`
  - Add `{this.state.name}` after Welcome to print `name`
- You can look at the following links for help with creating forms
  - [React forms on reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)
  - [React forms on w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_forms.asp)

## Your turn: input-app-button-javascript (30 minutes)

Extend [`input-app-javascript`](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Samples/tree/main/Week_1/input-app-javascript) by using a form. The Welcome text changes, when the Submit button is clicked
