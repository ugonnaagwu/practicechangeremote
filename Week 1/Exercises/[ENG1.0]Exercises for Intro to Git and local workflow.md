# Additional, OPTIONAL Exercises

This page provides additional information, and some suggestions for OPTIONAL exercises that you can do to help refine your knowledge of and comfort with this lesson.

## Background / review

* Read this article explaining [what is version control?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
* Remember that version control is essential in team software development and working with multiple people on code

### What is Git and GitHub (and how are they different?)

* Watch this 7 min video to give you a brief introduction on git vs github [![Git vs GitHub](https://yt-embed.herokuapp.com/embed?v=mPNp0PnhYyA)](https://youtu.be/mPNp0PnhYyA)
* Here is another one for you that you can Watch - [What is Git and GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUuTYDg9XoI)

#### Git and GitHub: Quick Summary

* **Git**: is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history
* **GitHub** : is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories

## Using Version Control (Git) in VS Code

Visual Studio Code has integrated source control and includes Git support in-the-box.

* Read this article to learn how to use [git in VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol)

* Experiment with the [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) that’s built into VS code to execute different git commands - try them out on your own!

* Complete this learning module - [Introduction to Version Control with Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/intro-to-vc-git/)
  * The exercises suggests using the sandbox. Instead, make sure that you’ve installed git and use Git in VS Code and the integrated terminal to become more familiar with them
    * There are lots of tools for using Git, just like there are lots of different programs to edit text or places to store files online.

## After-Class Exercises and Review

* On your personal computer try creating a new repository and put a file(s) into that repo.  A web page would be great (so you can practice with both git and HTML/CSS/etc)(an easy way to do this is to first create the folder, then initialize the repo inside that folder, then browse to a page and tell your browser to save that page into the repo.  You can then commit everything that the browser saved as your “initial commit”)
Try making some changes to the page and experiment with git commands as you make changes to the files.
