# How Might We and Ideation

This session continues in the define phase of the design thinking phases and moves into ideate. You'll expand thinking on your problem statement.

## Objectives

* Understand how to use the 'how might we' framework to expand thinking.
* Learn strategies for drawing ideas.
* Practice pitching early ideas.

## Actions

Together read [HMW and Ideation](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum-2023/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/1.3%20-%20HMW%20and%20ideation.pdf). This document introduces the ideate phase of design thinking. The goal is to expand thinking in a problem space and sketch a whole range of solution ideas. This is the time to go big on ideas of how to address your problem statements. The document has examples of the  team activities.

### Brainstorm with HMW

1. Revisit the problem statement affinity diagram.
2. As a group, choose the top two areas to explore further. Make sure all voices are heard.
3. Expand on those problem statements with HMW. Start a new shared white board. Write the two problem statement themes to work from.
    * For 5 minutes, individually, come up with as many HMW statements related to the problem statements.
    * Put one on each sticky note.
4. Regroup. Take turns sharing each note you wrote.
    * Group like items together to create a new infinity diagram.
5. Pick two themes. Build two concise problem statements from the groups you've created.
    * The problem statements should be meaningful, actionable, and human-centric.

### Kick off 8s

Next we're moving on to 8s. You're responsible for keeping your own time. Focus on high-level solutions and move beyond just an app or technology. Anything is possible. There is no limit.

### Two rounds of 8s and sharing

2 x  8s

1. Fold a paper into eight sections and pick one of the How Might We problem statements to start with.
2. Start a timer for 5 minutes. Draw something in each section.
3. Regroup as a team and share each section.
4. Repeat (with the other problem statement)!

Wrap up:

* Take a picture of each of your 8s. Add it to the folder in your Team's channel.
* You can repeat this as needed to keep ideating.

## Follow up

Share your ideas with your coaches.
