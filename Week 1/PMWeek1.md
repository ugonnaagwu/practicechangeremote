# Welcome to Product Development

As a team you will refine a problem statement, user needs, iterate on solutions, plan, and build a prototype together.  You'll envision, design, and build something incredible! This path compliments the work you're doing with web development. In week 3, they really come together when you'll write your plan, spec, and -once signed-off by your coaches- start development.

On Mondays (or Tuesday this week) you have an hour as a team to come together and review what's needed for the week, what product development related activities you should complete and milestones to hit as a team. Many of these will be familiar from the PM workshop. You'll need to use some of your individual and team work time to complete the deliverables. How you break it down is up to you, but get started on Monday and don't leave it all until the end of the week. Keep all the artifacts and deliverables in your Teams folder so everyone has access and can find them.

These weekly guides are here to help you figure it all out. These topics and deliverables are also great items to share and discuss in your Team + Coach time. Seek your coaches input and feedback. Reach out if you're stuck and they can help you unblock.

By the end of this week:

Deadlines:
* By end of day Tuesday choose the problem statement you want to work with from the set of four.
* By end of day Friday post your refined problem statement to your Teams channel. 

Each of the PM#.# files has recommended actions and followups to help you get the project done.

In general, a best practice is post in your Team channel and share as you go. The topics call out good times to do so.
