# PM Week 1

Welcome to week 1. This week is focused on the empathize and define phases and at the end of the week some ideation. You'll explore the needs of your target audience and refine the problem statement further.

## Recommended schedule
It’s up to the team to work through the design phases together. The resources can be found in: https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum-2023/tree/main/Week%201. 

Here’s a recommended schedule:

*  Monday: Read [PM1.0 Intro to PM and design thinking](Week%201/[PM1.0]%20Intro%20to%20PM%20and%20design%20thinking.md) – refresher from week 0. and [PM1.1 Empathize](Week%201/[PM1.1]%20Empathize%20with%20users.md). Begin user research.
* Tuesday: Conduct user research.
* Wednesday: Complete the empathy map and read [PM1.2 Define needs](Week%201/[PM1.2]%20Define%20needs.md) 
* Thursday: Create personas and complete user journey maps. Take another pass at problem statement and again narrow the problem statement based on what you’ve explored through the week. Read [PM1.3 HMW and Ideation](Week%201/[PM1.3]%20HMW%20and%20ideation.md). 
* Friday: From the refined problem statement, stretch ideation on how to solve for it with HMW and 8s.
