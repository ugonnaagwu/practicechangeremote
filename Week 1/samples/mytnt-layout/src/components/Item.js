import React from 'react'; 

//HINT: use Card as a model to build the Item Component

//TODO: create the Item Component as a function using the arrow function syntax

//TODO: Don't forget to export the component so that it is available to import into the Card component

//Usage sample: <Item name="Zara Thomas" email="zthomas@home.com" team={16}/>
