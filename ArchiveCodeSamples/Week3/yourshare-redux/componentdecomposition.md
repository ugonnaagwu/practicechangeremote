# YourShare: Decomposition of the pages into components

(P0s only)

## SignUp page - Christelle

![account](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/YourShare-screens/YS_account.png)

3 components for the signup page:

### Brand component

  * Name of the app
  * Logo of the app
  * Not reused
  
### SignUp component

  * Text: Join your community
  * Text: Signup 
  * 3 input boxes: Username, phone number, zip code
  * Button: Join
  * Not reused 
  * This could be reused anywhere in the app where I want to have sign up
  
### SignIn component

  * Button for signing in
  * Not reused
  
### Why this choice?

* Thinking about reusability
* Thinking about things that go together

### When going to coding

This is not for the breakdown work but we wanted to show you how the breakdown then will be used during coding.

You got the signoff of your coach or/and your instructor?

Each component is a file. Here see brand.tsx, signup.tsx and signin.tsx.
