# Coaches guide

This resource is aimed at coaches to follow the curriculum, guide prototype development, and infuse the curriculum with real-world product and development experiences. It's a guide, adapt to your team and where they're at.

## Week 0

NTs are onboarding.

## Week 1

Wooooot! This week we start working with our teams. Monday kicks off with a meet & greet lunch. Then we begin regular coach meeting time Tues, Wed, Thur 1pm-2pm. 

This week introduces the basic technologies and tools the prototypes will be built with. NTs begin building with JavaScript and React in VS Code. NTs are also introduced to Git and the basic Git flow. The week ends with NTs building a basic list app.

NT teams are given a broad problem statement. NTs are introduced to the product development lifecycle and work in teams to break down the problem statement into concrete and addressable user needs. This week includes activities to empathize with the user, define user needs, ideate, and sketch. One early callout to emphasize, while the prototype the NTs build is ultimate a web app, the idea it can represent can be much larger. It could be the gui interface to a physical device or the portal to a broader community effort. The MVPs can be small screen, representing a mobile app, or large screen.

When teams are working on the problem statements guide them towards something that is meaningful, actionable, and human centric. Encourage NTs to think bold and big as they begin ideating. Ensure they're grounded in customer needs. Challenge their assumptions.

The NTs have a few general problem areas to choose from. On Tuesday they'll pick this higher-level area and on Friday refine to a more concise statement. 

## Week 2

Early in the week NTs continue and wrap up working on their list app. In the Git learning track, NTs are introduced to remote repositories.  Applying, NTs move their list app to GitHub. Components are introduced early in the week and re-iterated throughout, along with UI debugging.

Working through the design phases, NTs  start the first iteration of the prototype and test. NTs create paper prototypes, begin early usability testing completing 2-3 interviews each by end of week, and create first drafts of their value prop and pitch. This is a great chance for the teams to get feedback on their concepts. Volunteer as a participant and listen to the pitch. The teams will still go through phases of expanding and refining app and feature ideas. When lost or debating, evaluate the solution to the problem statement against how well it meets the user needs.

NTs may ask or seek out people in their target audience to test with. This is great! Each NT should conduct pilot rounds with other NTs or people they're living with, and vet the study preparedness with coaches.

* Be a participant and review their study material and execution. Make sure it's ready to go with an audience and their interview skills are up to par.
* Make sure they have a plan for the interview logistics remotely and they're valuing the participants time. NTs are representing the program.
* If the NTs don't have connections to their target audience, if you're comfortable connect them with someone you know or reach out in the coaches chat to make connections.

## Week 3

This week teams complete a practice team engineering project from a sample spec - YourShare. It's not a complete prototype, the first couple of changes for the scaffolding of the app to practice team engineering and merging. NTs will be introduced to Redux. Adaptive layout, animation, and using component libraries are introduced later in the week.

On the product side, NTs narrow down towards their MVP with a walkthrough. Applying feedback from their usability testing and considering what best demonstrates meeting the user needs, NTs close on final features. The [PowerPoint template](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Wireframe%20template.pptx) is recommended for creating the walk through, though if NTs are productive with another tool they should move forward with that.

The spec is introduced Wednesday and NTs work on it throughout. The goal is for teams to get coach's sign off on the spec by the following Tuesday. Teams cannot start working on their MVP until the spec is signed-off by both coaches. The spec includes goals and measurable outcomes, two topics new to the NTs. Future considerations can include team thinking on the business model for the app. If you've been waiting for a chance to dive in on data, data in real world development and products, here's your chance. Help the NTs land solid engagement metrics and share your experience with data in product development. The metrics should help the NTs learn if their product is meeting the user needs they've identified.

### Spec sign-off tips

The spec is a big come together moment. It defines what the NTs will build for the MVP prototype. NTs cannot begin work on the spec until they have coach sign-off. Share your experiences around specs and engineering planning. Revisit the concept of MVP (minimum-viable-product) to help frame scoping.

Check-in on where your team is in understanding the spec process. Topics to cover:

* The spec brings together work from all phases of the design lifecycle. From their definition of the problem statement, to customer research, SWOT analysis, it all comes together in the spec.
* Discuss the engineering work break down using the prioritized list of user scenarios from the walkthrough. For the engineering work there should be a screen and a technical description of how it's built.
* Talk about how the team is working on the spec together. Everyone should write some portion of the spec and do engineering work break down.
* If they're still working on the walk though, no problem. That piece can come last.

The spec introduces metrics through goals. The NTs think through how they'll measure success in whether the app is meeting the user needs. We don't have too much time in the program to spend on metrics and measuring outcomes. This is a good chance to dive in and bring the real world engineering.

* Talk about how you measure your product and work from end user metrics to performance telemetry.
* In the spec process help NTs pick solid engagement metrics.
* There's not a focus on funding or revenue in product development curriculum. We don't want this to block big ideas from the get go and time is limited in what we can cover. Future opportunities in the spec is a good place for NTs to include this. Stakeholders might ask questions on this topic. Have a discussion at some point this week and jump start some thinking on business models - ads, subscriptions, freemium. Again, not a focus of the program but an important consideration for product managers and a real world thing.

The goal is spec sign-off by end of Tuesday, 7/20. For sign-off specs must:

* Have all sections
* Have the problem statement well articulated
* Clearly breakdown the work with UX mock, engineering description, and who's building what
     * Everyone should have a core engineering contribution
     * Everyone should have an engineering stretch goal
* Be in OneNote or a Word document. It should be saved in their team folder.
* Have contributions from everyone.
* Once ready, both coaches should say so and post in the team's team channel that they sign-off.

## Week 4

After spec sign-off, this week NTs begin building their prototype. The target for spec sign-off is Tuesday. 

Encourage NTs to get continuous feedback on their app as it's built. Share with other teams, test with people around, make minor adjustments. As NTs are building, advocate for frequent commits and merging following the team GitHub process. Also support NTs in continuing to practice and refine their app pitch.

This week the details of the final presentation will be shared. NTs don't need to start working on it yet, just providing clarity on where they're headed in addition to the prototype and pitch.

On the curriculum side, previous topics are re-enforced and some stretch topics are introduced.

## Week 5

This week curriculum topics and stretch topics will continued to be covered by the instructors. The MVP prototype should really be coming together. By end of week there should be an end to end working version meeting the P0s and likely P1s defined in the spec.

Continue encouraging testing the prototype and practice pitching.

By end of week NTs should have an outline for their final presentation as well.

## Week 6

This is the last week of the program. NTs should be wrapping up work on their prototype and preparing for the final presentation.

No new engineering topics are introduced this week. Instructors may revisit and help NTs unblock with any last minute MVP needs.

An additional deliverable is the presentation summary. This is a short snippet that captures the pitch and app demo.
