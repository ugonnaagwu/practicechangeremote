# Spec

This section introduces the spec (specification) deliverable. It describes how a spec is used in the product development lifecycle and provides an overview of the sections typically found in the spec.

## Objectives

* Learn about specs and their place in the product life cycle.

## Actions

In preparation for the YourShare Project, read this about the purpose and components of a spec.

The spec (specification) describes what is going to be built and why. The spec process is usually led by the PM. Many members of the future crew contribute to the spec and the spec is representative of what was leaned and explored in the phases of design thinking.

Specs come in different sizes and different levels of detail depending on the project. A small feature addition to an existing product might have a lightweight spec in OneNote. The specification for a new bridge will be much more in depth to capture the complex construction process and safety requirements. Ask your PM coaches about different specs they've written.

Our specs will also include a work breakdown that's usually included in the spec or as part of a separate engineering document. It describes how the engineering work will be done and how the app and features will be built.

The parts of the spec are:

* Problem statement - defines what the product is solving
* Summary - background on why this product is needed, your product pitch is a good fit here
* Customer profile - who is the product for, what does the reader of the spec need to know in order to understand the user needs
* Goals - what are you improving in the customer's life, how will you measure it
* In scope scenarios - the user stories that the product will fulfill
* Out of scope scenarios - the user stories that the app will not fulfill at this time, what the app is intentionally not including at this point, good ideas for the app but not part of the MVP
* UX - walkthroughs of the screens in the product
* Breakdown of work - engineering descriptions of how the app and features are being built, who's working on what
* Compete analysis - who are the top competitors, what are the apps strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
* Future opportunities - what would you build next? What's the big dream for the product?

The spec serves several purposes:

* It gets the future crew on the same page about what you're building and why
* It communicates to stakeholders what you're building and they can give you feedback and the thumbs-up to go ahead
* By laying everything out, you can plan so that what you build is your MVP, meets user needs, and prioritize the work

In the spec you should prioritize the user stories and the engineering work you will do first in your MVP. Use this system:

* A 0-3 ranking ranking system is used to prioritize work. It defines the order in which things will be built.
* A P0 (priority-0, said 'p zero') item is a must. There's no way the product or feature can ship or be released without the user story. The product will be delayed and not ship if these aren't ready on time.
* A P1 is a user story that's high on the priority list, it's likely that you will accomplish all of these before shipping. If you don't it will not block the product from shipping but you would likely ship it in an update as soon as possible.
* A P2 is an user story with a medium priority. If all goes well you will likely get to all of these before you ship.
* A P3 is a user story with low priority. It's unlikely you'll get to any of these, but if you do they're nice to have. For our purposes and the limited development time we have for the prototypes, move P3 and the remaining user stories to the Out of Scope section.
