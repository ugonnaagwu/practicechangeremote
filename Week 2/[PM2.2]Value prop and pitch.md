Read [Value prop and pitching](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/2.2%20-%20Value%20prop%20and%20pitch.pdf). The deck introduces what value proposition is, a value prop framework for creating a value prop for your app, why it's important, and tips for pitching.

### Develop value prop

Make a first draft of your value prop.

* Use the template as an outline.
* Capture your value prop in OneNote or a Word doc. Feel free to work individually at first or together - whatever works best for your team.
* Use your value prop to build a pitch.

### Practice pitching

Take turns pitching as a team. Everyone should give it a go. Say the pitch in your own words.

Key considerations for audience:

* Be mindful. This is the first go. Comfort and experience with public speaking varies. Build your team up.
* Give constructive feedback. Ask open ended questions. Hold questions until the end.

## Follow up

* Share your value prop and pitch with your coaches.
* Keep iterating as you learn from users and get feedback. Questions are a clue to what could be clearer in the pitch.
