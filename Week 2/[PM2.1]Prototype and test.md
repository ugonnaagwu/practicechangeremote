# Prototype and test

Explore ideas through prototyping, starting with low fidelity options.

## Objectives

* Build a paper prototype.
* Understand how prototyping fits into the product life cycle.
* Learn how to and practice testing a prototype.

## Action

Read [Prototype and test](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum/blob/main/Reference/Product%20decks/2.1%20-%20Prototype%20and%20test.pdf). This document builds on the ideate design phases, getting into more app details with a paper prototype. It introduces the role of UX designer. Large screen vs. small screen considerations are discussed. It introduces different tools for creating prototypes and describes the value of prototyping.

### Create low-fidelity prototypes

1. Individually, pick one solution you want to explore further from Crazy 8s, or something related to your leading problem statement. Share with your team what you're working on.
2. Draw the high-level, low-fidelity screens or flow of the experience. Considering whether this should be a mobile or large screen experience.
3. You might have multiple options for a given task or user job. If you're not sure yet, draw the other options.
4. Take pictures of your prototype and add to your team's folder.

Regroup as a team and share your walkthroughs.

### Combine walkthroughs

1. Combine your walkthroughs as a team. Take the best from each individual walktrhough and draw updates to have a similar combined flow.
2. To prioritize, focus on which tasks you want to get feedback on and how it ties back to your goals. You may have a few different options for a task or solutions to how a user need is meet. Consider different people drawing and later testing these different options.
3. Add the tasks for the prototypes to your interview guide.
4. Take pictures of the prototypes and add to your team's folder.

## Follow up

Share your prototypes with your coaches.

This week, use your paper prototype to conduct usability studies with people you live with, or local regulation permitting, people nearby. If in-person usability isn't possible, take pictures and do remote sessions with other NTs, coaches, or mentors. Conduct 2-3 by end of week and compile your results with your team.
