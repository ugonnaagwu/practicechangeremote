# Welcome to Week 2

Last week you were introduced to your problem area, spent time empathizing and determining user needs, wrote a refined version of your problem statement and ideated to explore potential solutions.

This week you'll continue on the design sprint journey. You'll land more detail on what you're building and why through further customer interviews and prototyping. This week also introduces the spec, a document that describes what you'll build. It'll first be used in an engineering project you do together called YourShare. Next week you'll write your own for your solution.

By the end of this week:
* [PM2.0](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum-PreSummer/blob/0e8af11ac292a7828ecef1720f7adb1cb3ed717d/Week%202/%5BPM2.0%5DUsability%20and%20interviewing.md) Create a user interview guide and conduct user interviews with a prototype.
* [PM2.1](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum-PreSummer/blob/main/Week%202/%5BPM2.1%5DPrototype%20and%20test.md) Create a low fidelity prototype for your user interviews.
* [PM2.2](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum-PreSummer/blob/0e8af11ac292a7828ecef1720f7adb1cb3ed717d/Week%202/%5BPM2.2%5DValue%20prop%20and%20pitch.md) Draft a value prop and pitch. This combines many of the deliverables to date. You'll refine it next week after you complete a competitor audit. 
* [PM2.3](https://github.com/tnt-summer-academy/Curriculum-PreSummer/blob/0e8af11ac292a7828ecef1720f7adb1cb3ed717d/Week%202/%5BPM2.3%5DIntro%20to%20spec.md) Read about the purpose and components of a spec for your engineering YourShare project.
